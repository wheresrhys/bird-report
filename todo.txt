- summer
- inner city records
- repeat file upload
- peak passage + differentiate early trickles from the main flow
    + would help to have a graph over time
- estimated throughput (upper + lower bounds, + different methodologies - calculate on demand... with slider)
    + ((b > 2 || w > 2) ? {} : {totalThrough: sum(records, ...passageMonths)}),
- for guessed breeding sites bring out the records with descriptions
- search for keywords in descriptions e.g greenland. Boolean OR
- don't bother with citywide site count if it's less than about 5
- pass bird data as props to bird page to avoid the weird infinite loop
- load new excel file
- handle options for each bird on that bird's tab
- Even if config says 'unknown' do the math for that tab, to account for real oddities e.g. winter whinchat
- when drilled WAY down onto records show the notes and other columns
- BUG - high single site counst only show one sitewhen clicking view records
- High single site/london wide counts when is only 1 is pointless... maybe even 2 or 3
