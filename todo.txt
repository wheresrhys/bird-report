- BUG - birds are sharing same settings when navigating (though not writing to wrong ones)
- peak passage + differentiate early trickles from the main flow
    + would help to have a graph over time
- estimated throughput (upper + lower bounds, + different methodologies - calculate on demand... with slider)
    + ((b > 2 || w > 2) ? {} : {totalThrough: sum(records, ...passageMonths)}),
- Machine learning counts by gender
- Build in the viz, allow a slider
- sliders on the graph to pick passage beginning and end dates
- in breeding season need _ALL_ records
- how many sites recorded >X birds on a single day?
- Each season's setting should be on that tab
- Each month's records should have daily totals and counts
- show settings form (or subset of it) on each season's page
